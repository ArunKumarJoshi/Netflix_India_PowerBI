# Netflix_India_PowerBI

The project aimed to analyze Netflix India's catalog of shows and movies to gain insights into content distribution, popular genres, ratings, and production details. The analysis was then visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore trends in content types, audience ratings, and production data.
